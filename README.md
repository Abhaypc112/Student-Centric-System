# Student Centric System

# Introduction
The "Student-Centric System" is a digital platform designed to enhance the student
experience within educational institutions by providing streamlined processes for event
updates and permissions. Through this system, students can access a centralized hub to stay
informed about upcoming events, such as lectures, workshops, extracurricular activities, and
administrative announcements. Additionally, the platform facilitates the efficient submission
and processing of permission requests for various activities, including participation in
events, field trips, and academic projects. Leveraging modern technologies such as web and
mobile interfaces, the system ensures accessibility and convenience for students, allowing
them to engage with the academic community seamlessly. By prioritizing the needs and
preferences of students, the Student-Centric System aims to foster a vibrant and inclusive
learning environment, promoting student participation, collaboration, and overall academic
success.
